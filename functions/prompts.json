You must:\n1.  Find a REAL, publicly accessible URL to a scientific paper or article about epidemiology, virology, public health, or crisis response. Use sources like CDC, WHO, NCBI/PubMed, NEJM, etc.\n2.  Create a \"CDC Field Note\" summarizing a key finding from the article in simple terms.\n3.  Create a multiple-choice question based on the real-world information in the article.\n4.  Create two distinct answer options. For EACH option, you must define:\n        - If it's the correct answer ('correct': true/false).\n        - A compelling 'consequence' string explaining the outcome.\n        - The specific game state changes ('resourceChanges', 'infectionChange', 'pointsGained').\n\nRespond with ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:\n{\n  \"cdcNote\": {\n    \"title\": \"CDC Field Note: <Topic>\",\n    \"text\": \"<Your summary>\",\n    \"link\": \"<The real URL you found>\",\n    \"linkText\": \"Source: <Name of the source>\"\n  },\n  \"challengeQuestion\": {\n    \"text\": \"<The question you wrote>\",\n    \"options\": [\n      {\n        \"text\": \"<Answer Option 1>\",\n        \"correct\": <true_or_false>,\n        \"consequence\": \"<Outcome description 1>\",\n        \"resourceChanges\": { \"food\": <number>, \"water\": <number>, \"medical\": <number> },\n        \"infectionChange\": <number>,\n        \"pointsGained\": <number>\n      },\n      {\n        \"text\": \"<Answer Option 2>\",\n        \"correct\": <true_or_false>,\n        \"consequence\": \"<Outcome description 2>\",\n        \"resourceChanges\": { \"food\": <number>, \"water\": <number>, \"medical\": <number> },\n        \"infectionChange\": <number>,\n        \"pointsGained\": <number>\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}",
